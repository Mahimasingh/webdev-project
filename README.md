Test that Node.js installed by typing the command node at the command line. A command prompt should appear waiting for additional commands. Type Ctrl+c twice to exit Node.js command line interpreter.

2. Set up MongoDB locally

MongoDB will be used to provide a local database to develop and debug database development.Your remote Node.js server will talk to your remote MongoDB instance. Your local Node.js server will talk to your local MongoDB instance.Download MongoDB and install on the local development machine as described in the MongoDB documentation.
